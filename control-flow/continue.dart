// The continue statement allows you to skip the current iteration of the loop prematurely and start the next iteration immediately.

// The continue statement is only valid when you use it inside a loop, including while, do while, and for loops.

// In practice, youâ€™ll want to start the next iteration if a condition is true. To do it, you use the continue statement with an if statement like this:

/*if (condition)
{
    continue;
}
*/
