// **********Blocks***********
/* In Dart, a block is a sequence of zero or more statements. A block is surrounded by curly braces ({}). For example, you can group statements into a block as follows:

{
   String message = 'Welcome to Dart!';
   print(message);
}

Unlike a statement, a block is not terminated by a semicolon (;)

*/

// ********Identifiers***********

/*Identifiers are names that you assign to the variables, constants, functions, etc. In Dart, the names of identifiers follow these rules:

The alphabetic ([a-z], [A-Z]) and underscore (_) characters can appear at any position.
Digits (0-9) cannot be in the first position but everywhere else.*/

// Identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, `message` and `Message` identifiers are different.

// Keywords

/*Keywords are names that have a special meaning to the Dart compiler. All keywords are reserved identifiers. Therefore, you cannot use them as the names of identifiers. For example, the following program has a compile-time error because `var` is a keyword:*/

// var = 'Hello, World!'; // Error: Can't use 'var' here (reserved keyword).

// Literals

/* Literals are primitive values in the program. For example, an integer has the following literal:

10
Code language: Dart (dart)
To form a literal string, you surround text with single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or triple quotes ("""). For example:

'Welcome to Dart!'
