## Basic Syntaxes

Dart syntaxes includes: _whitespace, statements, identifiers, keywords, literals, and comments_.

## Whitespace

In Dart, whitespace refers to characters that don’t have visible output, which includes:

> Carriage return
>
> Space
>
> New Line
>
> Tab

When compiling the source code, the Dart compiler ignores the _whitespaces_. However, you’ll use _whitespaces_ to format the code to make it easier to read.
